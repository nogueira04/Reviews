Feature: Admin user

  As an administrator of the Reviews platform
  I want to create, remove and edit users, delete common user accounts,
  register artists, authors, voice actors, and publish news
  So that the content, catalog and community of the platform stay organised

  Scenario: ban a common user successfully
    Given the admin identifies a user who violated the rules
    When the admin bans the user from the moderation panel
    Then the user content is hidden from everyone but not deleted

  Scenario: create a news post with tags and see it on the feed
    Given the admin publishes a news post with free tags
    When the news post is created
    Then the news post shows up on the common users feed
